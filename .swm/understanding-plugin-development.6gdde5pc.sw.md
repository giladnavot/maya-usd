title: Understanding Plugin Development
---

Plugin Development in the maya-usd repository involves creating reusable libraries and functionalities for Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD). This is done within the 'plugin' directory, specifically within the 'pxr/maya/lib/pxrUsdMayaGL' subdirectory. Here, you can find various test environments for different aspects of the plugin, such as 'BatchRendererIsolateSelectionTest', 'InstancerDrawTest', and 'RefAssemblyDrawRepresentationsTest'. These tests are crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of the developed plugins.
