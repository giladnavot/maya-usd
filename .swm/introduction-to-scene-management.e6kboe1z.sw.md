title: Introduction to Scene Management
---

Scene Management in the maya-usd repository refers to the process of defining, manipulating, and rendering 3D objects in a virtual environment. This involves creating and organizing various elements such as meshes, cameras, lights, and other entities that make up a 3D scene. The management of these elements is crucial for the visualization and interaction with 3D models in a scene. The scene data is typically stored in files with formats like .usda or .ma, which contain detailed information about the objects, their properties, and their relationships to each other.

# Scene Creation

This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a 3D scene with a cube model. The cube model is defined with its geometry and shading variants. This is a part of scene management where objects are created and their properties are defined.

# Scene Manipulation

This code snippet shows how a scene is manipulated in Maya. It includes the creation of cameras, lights, and objects, as well as setting their properties and relationships. This is another aspect of scene management where elements within the scene are controlled and organized.
