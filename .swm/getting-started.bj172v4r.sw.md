# Running and Debugging the Main Parts of the Repo

The `Run` function in `build.py` is used to run the specified command in a subprocess. This is used for building and installing the libraries.

```python
def Run(context, cmd):
    """Run the specified command in a subprocess."""
    PrintInfo('Running "{cmd}"'.format(cmd=cmd))

    with codecs.open(context.logFileLocation, "a", "utf-8") as logfile:
        logfile.write("#####################################################################################" + "\n")
        logfile.write("log date: " + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") + "\n")
```
