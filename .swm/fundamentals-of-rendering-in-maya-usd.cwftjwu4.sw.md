title: Fundamentals of Rendering in Maya-USD
---

Rendering in the maya-usd repository refers to the process of generating an image from a 3D scene. This is done by converting the scene data, which includes geometry, lighting, shading, and camera information, into a 2D image. The rendering process is crucial in visualizing the scene created in Maya with the help of the maya-usd plugin.

# Rendering Process

This file contains the implementation of the ProxyRenderDelegate class, which is responsible for the rendering process in the viewport. It uses the Hydra render delegate to perform the rendering.
